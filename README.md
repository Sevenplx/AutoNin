# AutoNin: Voice-to-Form AI Assistant

AutoNin is a smart AI-powered web assistant that allows users to fill out digital forms simply by **speaking**. It listens to your natural speech, transcribes it in real time, and intelligently fills in fields like your **name, email, phone number, and address**.

This project was designed to improve **accessibility**, save time, and showcase the power of **speech-to-text AI**, all built with **Python (Flask)** and **Faster-Whisper**.
